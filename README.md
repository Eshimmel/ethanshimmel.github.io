About Me Section:
I am a hard working student with a 4.0 GPA. I play basketball and baseball here at York County School of Technology. I am able to adapt to many different work environments. I would prefer to work as a game developer but look to go to college first. I want to be able to build my own game and create a company from it. Looking for employers that will help me succeed in achieving my goals.
